# Hangman-Game
The Hangman game is a word-guessing game where players attempt to discover a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time. Players have a limited number of incorrect guesses before a hangman is fully drawn. The game randomly selects words from a predefined list and provides hints. Players guess letters, revealing correctly guessed ones in the word. Incorrect guesses lead to the gradual drawing of a hangman. The game ends when the word is guessed or when the hangman is fully drawn. It's typically played on a web page with interactive buttons for letter choices and features a modal displaying results. The player's objective is to guess the word before running out of guesses.
